# Task Documentation
This repository contains two exercises.

## Exercise 1: Console based E-commerce cart system where users can add products to their cart, update quantities, and view the total bill. The system contains following features:

### Overview
The E-Commerce Cart System is a console-based application that allows users to manage their shopping cart by adding, updating, and removing products while maintaining accurate stock levels. It supports multiple discount strategies, such as percentage-based and Buy One Get One Free, and ensures traceability through a centralized logging system. Built with design patterns like Singleton, Strategy, and Prototype, the system is modular, extensible, and user-friendly.

  * **Add Products**: Add new products to the cart.
  * **Update Products**: Update items in the cart.
  * **Remove Products**: Remove products from the cart.
  * **Apply Discounts**: Apply different types of discounts to the cart.
  * **Add stock**: Adding stock levels to the products.
  * **View Cart and Total Bill**: The system will show all items in the cart with their quantities and subtotals.
  * **Logging**: Record actions performed within the application.
  * **Exception Handling**: Manage invalid operations.

# Key Features: 
  * Uses Design Patterns like Singleton, Strategy, and Prototype.
  * Follows SOLID principle and Object-Oriented Programming practices.
  * Includes comprehensive logging, exception, and error handling.

## **Exercise 2: Design Pattern Exercises**

### Overview 
This exercise demonstrates the application of various design patterns through practical examples. The included patterns are:

### **Creational Pattern**
  * **Builder Pattern**: A simple car manufacurer application that builds cars with various components such as engine, transmission, color, sunroof and GPS.
  * **Factory Pattern**: A Pizza store application that creates instances of various pizzes(CheesePizza, VeggiePizza, PepperoniPizza) using a Factory methid.
  * **Singleton Pattern**: A simple Logger application that ensures only single instance of the object is used throughout the application.

### **Behavioral Pattern**
  * **Chain Of Responsiblity Pattern**: An approval application that handlers process chain of requests.
  * **Momento Pattern**: A text editor example which demonstrates how to capture and restore the state of an object without       exposing its internal structure.
  * **Observer Pattern**: A simple social media example shows hoe the observers are notified of changes in a subject.

### **Structural Pattern**
  * **Adapter Pattern**: An USB Cable example where an adapter allows a cable to connect a USB Type-B device to a USB Type-C interface.
  * **Facade Pattern**:  Home Theater System that provides a simplified interface to control multiple subsystems (DVD player,sound system , and projector).
  * **Proxy Pattern**: Bank Application where a proxy controls access to a real bank account, managing deposits and withdrawals, and checking balance.
